Proof of concept

To Do this week:
Full path
How to do forms in xls form
	maybe autoadvance stuff, see if makes sense, (usually for navigation not filling out)
	Do we want all the questions on one slide or one slide each
		(think our plan was one slide each)

Predicates:
	have a way to open collect and cause it to go to each form
	load each form and evaluate specially named node
	standard calculate inside of collect
		which can take current time
		puts in variable in model which doesnt have to be visible
	in place of writing expression evaluator

History:
	create graph from instances->saved in xml form
	tag important bit of information, save in database
	
Chuong: finish up security, history page, library for making graphs, XLS Form(s)
Jake: get API token for RedCap, expression evaluator, XLS Form(s)
Emily: Calendar w/notification service, XLS Form(s)
