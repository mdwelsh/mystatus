For next week: (by priority)
	1. Open up surveys: ask odk what are all the surveys and what are recent survey results
		which ones need to be filled out today
	2. Remove finalized but not set, layer of abstraction
		remove button
		try to send to next form to fill out, straight into it (queue?)
	3. Tell odk aggregate that its a new version of same survey

Meeting with profs:
Inside ODK Collect: looks in ODK directory for forms
	want it not to find form, but pointer into database where form stored
	want to ask database to give form unencrypted w/key
	modification to form reading
	ODK gets xml but also rebuilds internal model of form everytime, slow because of this
	w/short forms, not big hit, could eliminate caching
	w/big forms, about 50 questions, noticably slower
	cache model, when pull, look for cached model
	throw away xml, store model?
	manage in forms subdirectory
		empty filename?
		or put extra table in forms database
Go to Amy with collect (mock) forms and goals
	with sample of what can have in there
	make sure her image is the same as ours
	anything linked to these questions (audio, video, etc)
