For next week: (by priority)
	1. Open up surveys: ask odk what are all the surveys and what are recent survey results
		which ones need to be filled out today	
	2. Remove finalized but not set, layer of abstraction
		remove button
		try to send to next form to fill out, straight into it (queue?)
	3. Tell odk aggregate that its a new version of same survey
