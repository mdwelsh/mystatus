Flow for Demo:
	application startup or get notification
	go to app -> tells which survey to fill out
	select-> fill out -> complete all or not
	filled out survey will appear in server somewhere (have this open to see it show up)
	notifications!! make easy to demonstrate <-- may need to change times when appear
		new surveys
		medications
		activities
		more than once
	choose order
	history table
		possible question:
		how long is this kept around?
		server probs keeps everything
		but what will we see, can we select how many, weekly vs monthly view?
