Notes
4/9/13

Needs:

not have to hit submit when going through the survey
should be submit if fill out a question

done with one survey, automatically go into another

ODK once finished with survey checks for component/callback to go back
to in our app




Questions:
Will the app user have to have ODK Collect installed to use it?
Or can we have it inside our app?

Security: hide ODK in our app

For Amy:
	Goals 
	
	
	
From meeting:
	how often to trigger (some randomness?)
	
	TODO:
	connecting ODK:
		when app asks about survey, question patient if want to do it first
		launch Collect if do
		when collect finishes (could finish in diff ways: complete form, finalize, close)
		ODK returns pointer to file with answers stored
			get an Intent with results
		if dont complete form:
			want to remind to finish or suggest finish now
			could have to change odk to do that
			ASK MITCH!!!
			msunt@cs??
		start app then start totally diff (dont close)
			setup timeout
			if dont get back after ___ min, do something?
	check out reminder apps, to not reinvent UI
	
	no way to hide that we have a depression survey in collect
	can just encrypt results or use google service
	
	Viewing information
		connection to database service that does this already
		ODK can directly go and put data using its API instead of aggregate
		OR
		go to aggregate, set it up to send to other service
	
	Maybe dont want to work too much on physicians web app
	
	Forms shouldnt display name, (level of indirection)

	How secure does this have to be
	
	Correspondence at server
		when downloads to device, doesnt know patient info, just knows formX needs to be filled every ___
		when form 1 is on phone, want to encrypt contents not just change name
		does the form need to stay on phone?
		The Guardian project (way to encrypt contents of SQLite database on phone)
			forms on database, guardian finds there, gets, unencrpyt, loads to collect as new form, then clean collect
			Guardian Android Database Encryption
		
	Maybe use database as filesystem using Guardian as encryption	
		
	Next week: approach on phone
		how to keep secure
		will those things proposed work
		where will data go (can push to aggregate for now as ex but want as encrypted mode at least)
		dont deal with password system right now
		where are forms
		where is data
		what is getting returned
