Intro:
	why take a survey
	WHY!!!
User sees notification to take surveys
Taps notification to go to the surveys
Fills out the given survey and submit
	We have Aggregate open so we can see it appear
A patient might want...
User checks out the history (will have been filled out more than this one time)
difference between aggregate and what we see on phone.

Then we go to aggregate to show how the physician can get the history
Then user sees a prescription notification pop up.
	We describe how it only has the time so that if others are using the phone
	they won't know specifically what that means
User doesn't remember what pill looks like so tap the notification
Realizing they dont want to take the pill because the side effects are too much,
	they go to the help screen to call their doctor
	
Problem->way we handled it
surveys filled out
figure out if we want to add in security
lock or not -> have it come up not at all or only beginning
	may be distracting
