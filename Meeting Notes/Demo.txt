patients with depression oftentimes dont follow through with their appointments.
we have developed an app that lets them self-manage their condition when that is the case.
our method of self management is to fill out surveys on their condition such as their mood.
to lessen the burden of remembering to take them we set up notifications to remind them.
oh look, heres one now.
	
Taps notification to go to the surveys

The GAD-7 survey is an example that asks me about my mood over the past few weeks
Fills out the given survey and submit

because a provider will want to know whats going on with their patients even when they dont come  in for appts, 
filled out surveys get sent to a server that collects them. providers can then log in to access the data
herre are previous results from the gad-7 survey

a patient might also want to track how theyre doing to see if theyve been improving
for that they can go to our history page and view a table of past results. this happens to look just 
like it would for a provider except that its patient specific.

now oftentimes patients will have a lot of prescriptions and sometimes cant remember when to take them.
they can enter that data to our app and set up some more notifications.
would you look at that? im supposed to take something now. as you can see, it doesnt have any information
about what im taking, we did this so unwanted users couldnt get private information if they borrowed the phone
the same was with our survey notification, which doesnt say snything about what condition is being treated.
but say i forgot what pill this was for, i can tap the notification and see the pic ive taken of it. great!

now say i didnt see improvement from my past results and the reminder to take pills has made me feel even more down,
i can go to the Get help page and call my physician or a friend!
