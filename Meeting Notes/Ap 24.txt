How do we want to use Collect:
  we want to make modifications in Collect
  Gaetano thinks there should be a barrier
    more it diverges, more work later

Encryption:
  Collect doesnt encrypt media or xml

Next week:
  how to evaluate what forms to display
  history page: previous survey responses (home screen button)

What to put in form to see when to fill out
Design form that can be filled out at will
Making superset of what's there
Well documented, clear doing something different

For later:
  signing into mystatus
  ask for pin or do a design
  but whenever loses focus

Next week:
  10 min presentation

Decide duties on project
  with rationale
